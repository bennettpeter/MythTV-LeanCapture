# Settings for a fire stick with LeanCapture
# If you have more than one fire stick setup. duplicate this file and
# create leancap2, leancap3, etc. It must be named leancapx.conf.
# ANDROID_MAIN: the ip address, dnsname, or host id of the fire stick
#    ethernet interface if used, otherwise the wifi interface.
# ANDROID_FALLBACK: the ip address, dnsname, or host id of the fire stick
#  wifi interface. Leaven blank if the wifi interface was used in
#  ANDROID_MAIN
# VIDEO_IN: Leave this out if you use leancap_scan.sh.
#  The system will dynamically
#  set this up by running leancap_scan.sh after a reboot or replugging
#  of USB recorder. It sets up all recorders that are named leancapx
#  If you don't want to use the dynamic script do as follows:
#  Find the correct video device (/dev/videoX) with
#  v4l2-ctl --list-devices.
#  Each device has 2 ids. Make sure to use the first (even numbered)
#  id of the two. If your computer has a camera as well as a capture
#  device you need to make sure to choose the correct one.
# INPUT_FORMAT: Run this to see the available formats.
#  Use the VIDEO_IN for the card. You need to figure this out by running
#  vlc against the port, which will be /dev/videox where x is an even
#  number from 0 up
#  ffmpeg -hide_banner -f v4l2 -list_formats all -i /dev/videoX
#  Choose a format with Compressed (mjpeg). Raw formats will
#  be too slow.
# RESOLUTION: Choose a video_size that goes with the format listed.
# AUDIO_IN: Leave this out if you use leancap_scan.sh.
#  If you have only one tuner and not using leancap_scan.sh do as follows:
#  Run vlc and find the correct alsa setting for your audio device
# FRAMERATE: Use
#  v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/videoX --list-formats-ext | less
#  This will give a list of possible framerates for each video_size
#  and input_format. You will see the framerate is much lower for
#  raw format than for mjpeg.
#  Set your fire tv device to use the specified resolution by
#  running vlc and selecting the resolution using the
#  android settings.

[TUNER]
# If [TUNER/command] is provided, it will be executed to "tune" the

# the current channel is already correct, this will be executed
# instead.
# Set the first parameter to match the name of this file without extension (leancapx)
